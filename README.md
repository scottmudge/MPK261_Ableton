# Ableton Remote Script - MPK261 Mod
The goal of this script modification is to streamline and improve the support for the MPK261 in Ableton, including: 

- Using the pads to record, launch, and control clips (Bank C & D).
- Adding expanded colors to the pads, indicating clip state (recording, playback, queued, etc.)
- Better binding for track selection, allowing multiple track arming and correction of default panning (+/- 0 instead of - inf.) for Control Bank A.
- Auto-binding knobs and sliders to instrument and effect modulators & controls for Control Bank B.
- Leaving Bank C available for custom bindings.

Much of these modifications are designed to ease the use of the MPK261 for live performance and for "sketching" musical ideas together, similar to the Push 2.
