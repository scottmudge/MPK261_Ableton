# Ableton Remote Script - MPK261 Mod
The goal of this script modification is to streamline and improve the support for the MPK261 in Ableton, including: 

- Using the pads to record, launch, and control clips (Bank C & D).
- Adding expanded colors to the pads, indicating clip state (recording, playback, queued, etc.)
- Better binding for track selection, allowing multiple track arming and correction of default panning (+/- 0 instead of - inf.) for Control Bank A.
- Auto-binding knobs and sliders to instrument and effect modulators & controls for Control Bank B.
- Leaving Bank C available for custom bindings.
